My name is **Michael Jahn** and I am a postdoctoral researcher in life sciences. Originally from Germany, I currently live in **Stockholm**, working at the **Science for Life Laboratory and formally employed by KTH**, the Royal Technical University in Sweden.

My primary field of interest is microbial biotechnology, in the widest sense. I like to work at the interphase of experimental and computational biology. I am an enthusiastic user of R statistical programming and python. I'm advocating for openness and transparency in science. When I'm not working I'm trying to raise my two kids, and travel around Sweden, Europe and elsewhere.
