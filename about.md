## About me

<img src="png/pic2_small.png" width="25%" align="right" />

My name is **Michael Jahn** and I am a postdoctoral researcher in life sciences. Originally from Germany, I currently live in **Stockholm**, working at the **Science for Life Laboratory and formally employed by KTH**, the Royal Technical University in Sweden.

My primary field of interest is microbial biotechnology, in the widest sense. I like to work at the inter-phase of experimental and computational biology. I am an enthusiastic user of R statistical programming, and python, just as I like travelling in Europe and elsewhere.
