I"x<p>In a few days starts the <strong>11th European workshop on the biology of
cyanobacteria</strong>. It was planned to take place in beautiful Porto,
Portugal. I was very much looking forward to this as I haven’t been on a
conference for a whole year. But unfortunately COVID-19 forced the
conference organizers to turn it into a digital meeting. This is not as
exciting as visiting a real conference (and a new city!) and meeting
people in person, but I’m nevertheless looking forward to it. I will
present my work on the <a href="projects">cell economy of cyanobacteria</a>. I
recorded the talk and you can watch it here:</p>
