I"<p>The corona virus crisis has overshadowed the life of many EU citizens
for quite some time now, and will likely continue to do so for the
coming months. The strict social distancing measures taken by many
governments leave work places deserted, factories standing still and
shops closed. However, one small country on the Northern edge of Europe
is going itâ€™s own way to tackle the CoV pandemic and it is highly
interesting how this experiment will turn out. None the least as I am
part of that experiment.</p>
