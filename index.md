**=== Awarded a FORMAS grant ===**

Swedish funding agency FORMAS has awarded me with a grant to continue ongoing work with the fascinating litho-autotrophic bacterium *Ralstonia eutropha* a.k.a. *Cupriavidus necator*. As usual in our lab, we will study the bug and its metabolic capabilities from the systems biology perspective. Many exciting things are planned but the **focus of the project is on resource allocation**: What does a versatile soil bacterium spends its carbon and energy for? Which routes will different substrates take through the cellular metabolism? Under which conditions are enzymes saturated (under-abundance), are not used at all (over-abundance)? We will try to answer these questions using highly controlled **steady state cultivation, proteomics, metabolic modeling, and not yet determined genetic engineering.**
