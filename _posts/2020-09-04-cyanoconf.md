In a few days starts the **11th European workshop on the biology of
cyanobacteria**. It was planned to take place in beautiful Porto,
Portugal. I was very much looking forward to this as I haven’t been on a
conference for a whole year. But unfortunately COVID-19 forced the
conference organizers to turn it into a digital meeting. This is not as
exciting as visiting a real conference (and a new city\!) and meeting
people in person, but I’m nevertheless looking forward to it. I will
present my work on the [cell economy of cyanobacteria](projects). I
recorded the talk and you can watch it here:
